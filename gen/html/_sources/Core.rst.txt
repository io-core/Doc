The Core Packages in Integrated Oberon contain those modules necessary 
for booting Oberon to a user interface (or to a command loop for an embedded 
Oberon) and those modules needed to recompile the core of Integrated Oberon.

Four packages comprise an Inner Core of Oberon -- Boot, Kernel, Files, and 
Modules. The modules in these four packages are linked into a bootable binary
image that, after being loaded by the boot mechanism of the host platform, will
load the rest of the Core Oberon system.
