Obtaining the Code
==================

Check out the main project on a Linux or Mac based system

This repo uses submodules, to get the whole thing:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/io-core/io
After cloning the submodules may not be checked out to the main branch so after the above command you should:

cd io; bash makemain.sh


Navigating the Code
===================

At the top of the repo are some shell scripts, folders for artifacts of the build process, and a root folder.

The directory structures under root mimic a potential future deployed self-hosting target system.

Within root the src/github.com/io-core path provides a home for the io-core project submodules needed to build the target system.

Within /root/src/github.com/io-core:

 * Boot contains source code for booting an IO target system and also shell scripts for building target artifacts on the host system.
 * Build contains the compiler source code used to compile the system, including the compiler itself.
 * Kernel, Files, and Modules comprise the inner core of the IO system.
 * Oberon, Edit, and System comprise the outer core of the IO system.
 * Assist, Attest, Crypto, Doc, Draw, Paint, Mod, ArgParse, and Test are standard packages in the IO system.
 * Examples, BASIC, C, Go, and Pascal are supplemental packages in the IO system.


Coding Guidelines
=================

On your own system, anything goes. Code intended for a Pull Request to Integrated Oberon however should aspire to simplicity, clarity, and generality.

Commit Message Conventions
